- C4 model - The C4 model is a set of architectural standard diagrams.
  - At its core, C4 contains four standard diagrams:
    - System Context diagram
    - Container diagram
    - Component diagram
    - Code diagram
    
    The system context diagram is at the highest level, illustrating an applicationâ€™s interfaces with users and other applications.
    Each subsequent level drills through a specific area of the application, providing ever more granular detail.
    The lowest level of granularity is the code diagram at the bottom.

  - The model also contains side diagrams:
    -  System landscape diagram, which illustrates how a portfolio of applications interacts
    -  Dynamic diagram, which illustrates how static elements work together at run time to form a feature
    -  Deployment diagram and illustrates the platform that an application is deployed on.
