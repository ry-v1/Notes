# Delta Lake - The Definitive Guide

- What Is Delta Lake?
    - Delta Lake is an open source storage layer that supports ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unification of streaming and batch data processing. 
    - It was initially designed to work with Apache Spark and large-scale data lake workloads.
    - With Delta Lake, you can build a single data platform with your choice of high-performance query engine to address a diverse range of workloads, including (but not limited to) business intelligence (BI), streaming analytics/complex event processing, data science, and machine learning.
- Common Use Cases
    - Developers in all types of organizations, from startups to large enterprises, use Delta Lake to manage their big data and AI workloads. Common use cases include: 
        - Modernizing data lakes : 
            Delta Lake helps organizations modernize their data lakes by providing ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and schema enforcement, thereby ensuring data reliability and performance improvements.
        - Data warehousing :
            There are both data warehousing technologies and techniques. The Delta Lake lakehouse format allows you to apply data warehousing techniques to provide fast query performance for various analytics workloads while also providing data reliability.
        - Machine learning/data science : 
            Delta Lake provides a reliable data foundation for machine learning and data science teams to access and process data, enabling them to build and deploy models faster.
        - Streaming data processing : 
            Delta Lake unifies streaming and batch data processing. This allows developers to process real-time data and perform complex transformations on the fly.
        - Data engineering
            Delta Lake provides a reliable and performant platform for data engineering teams to build and manage data pipelines, ensuring data quality and accuracy.
        - Business intelligence : 
            Delta Lake supports SQL queries, making it easy for business users to access and analyze data and thus enabling them to make data-driven decisions.
    - Overall, Delta Lake is used by various teams, including data engineers, data scientists, and business users, to manage and analyze big data and AI workloads, ensuring data reliability, performance, and scalability.
