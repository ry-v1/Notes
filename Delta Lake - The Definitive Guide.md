# Delta Lake - The Definitive Guide

- What Is Delta Lake?
    - Delta Lake is an open source storage layer that supports ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and unification of streaming and batch data processing. 
    - It was initially designed to work with Apache Spark and large-scale data lake workloads.
    - With Delta Lake, you can build a single data platform with your choice of high-performance query engine to address a diverse range of workloads, including (but not limited to) business intelligence (BI), streaming analytics/complex event processing, data science, and machine learning.

- Common Use Cases
    - Developers in all types of organizations, from startups to large enterprises, use Delta Lake to manage their big data and AI workloads. Common use cases include: 
        - Modernizing data lakes : 
            Delta Lake helps organizations modernize their data lakes by providing ACID transactions, scalable metadata handling, and schema enforcement, thereby ensuring data reliability and performance improvements.
        - Data warehousing :
            There are both data warehousing technologies and techniques. The Delta Lake lakehouse format allows you to apply data warehousing techniques to provide fast query performance for various analytics workloads while also providing data reliability.
        - Machine learning/data science : 
            Delta Lake provides a reliable data foundation for machine learning and data science teams to access and process data, enabling them to build and deploy models faster.
        - Streaming data processing : 
            Delta Lake unifies streaming and batch data processing. This allows developers to process real-time data and perform complex transformations on the fly.
        - Data engineering
            Delta Lake provides a reliable and performant platform for data engineering teams to build and manage data pipelines, ensuring data quality and accuracy.
        - Business intelligence : 
            Delta Lake supports SQL queries, making it easy for business users to access and analyze data and thus enabling them to make data-driven decisions.
    - Overall, Delta Lake is used by various teams, including data engineers, data scientists, and business users, to manage and analyze big data and AI workloads, ensuring data reliability, performance, and scalability.

- Anatomy of a Delta Lake Table
    - A Delta Lake table or Delta table comprises several key components that work together to provide a robust, scalable, and efficient data storage solution. The main elements are as follows:
    - Data files: Delta Lake tables store data in Parquet file format. These files contain the actual data and are stored in a distributed cloud or on-premises file storage system such as HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage (or Azure Data Lake Storage [ADLS] Gen2), GCS (Google Cloud Storage), or MinIO. Parquet was chosen for its efficiency in storing and querying large datasets.
    - Transaction log: The transaction log, also known as the Delta log, is a critical component of Delta Lake. It is an ordered record of every transaction performed on a Delta Lake table. The transaction log ensures ACID properties by recording all changes to the table in a series of JSON files. Each transaction is recorded as a new JSON file in the _delta_log directory, which includes metadata about the transaction, such as the operation performed, the files added or removed, and the schema of the table at the time of the transaction.
    - Metadata: Metadata in Delta Lake includes information about the table’s schema, partitioning, and configuration settings. This metadata is stored in the transaction log and can be retrieved using SQL, Spark, Rust, and Python APIs. The metadata helps manage and optimize the table by providing information for schema enforcement and evolution, partitioning strategies, and data skipping.
    - Schema: A Delta Lake table’s schema defines the data’s structure, including its columns, data types, and so on. The schema is enforced on write, ensuring that all data written to the table adheres to the defined structure. Delta Lake supports schema evolution (add new columns, rename columns, etc.), allowing the schema to be updated as the data changes over time.
    - Checkpoints: Checkpoints are periodic snapshots of the transaction log that help speed up the recovery process. Delta Lake consolidates the state of the transaction log by default every 10 transactions. This allows client readers to quickly catch up from the most recent checkpoint rather than replaying the entire transaction log from the beginning. Checkpoints are stored as Parquet files and are created automatically by Delta Lake.

- Delta Transaction Protocol
    - The Delta transaction log protocol is the specification defining how clients interact with the table in a consistent manner. 
    - At its core, all interactions with the Delta table must begin by reading the Delta transaction log to know what files to read. 
    - When a client modifies the data, the client initiates the creation of new data files (i.e., Parquet files) and then inserts new metadata into the transaction log to commit modifications to the table.
    
    - Serializable ACID writes : Multiple writers can modify a Delta table concurrently while maintaining ACID semantics.
    - Snapshot isolation for reads : Readers can read a consistent snapshot of a Delta table, even in the face of concurrent writes.
    - Scalability to billions of partitions or files: Queries against a Delta table can be planned on a single machine or in parallel.
    - Self-describing : All metadata for a Delta table is stored alongside the data. This design eliminates the need to maintain a separate metastore to read the data and allows static tables to be copied or moved using standard filesystem tools.
    - Support for incremental processing : Readers can tail the Delta log to determine what data has been added in a given period of time, allowing for efficient streaming.
